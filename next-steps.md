# HomeGrow Forecast Tool - Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps to make the HomeGrow Forecast Tool 100% functional, based on the implementation plan and the tools that have been created.

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Test MongoDB Connection

Use the MongoDB connection test script to verify that the database connection is working correctly:

```bash
cd backend
node test-mongodb.js
```

If the test fails, follow the troubleshooting steps in [mongodb-troubleshooting.md](mongodb-troubleshooting.md).

### 2. Check Server Environment

Use the server status script to check your environment and diagnose any server startup issues:

```bash
cd backend
node server-status.js
```

If there are issues, follow the troubleshooting steps in [server-startup-troubleshooting.md](server-startup-troubleshooting.md).

### 3. Start the Backend Server

Start the backend server using the server manager script:

```bash
cd backend
npm run server:start
```

Verify that the server is running by checking the API health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

### 4. Test Authentication

Run the authentication test script to verify that the authentication system is working correctly:

```bash
cd backend
node test-auth.js
```

Fix any issues that are identified during testing.

### 5. Start the Frontend

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

### 6. Test API Integration

Use the ApiStatus component to check the API connectivity:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-status
```

If there are issues, use the ApiTester component for more detailed testing.

## Next Phase: Complete Implementation

Once the basic functionality is working, proceed with the following steps:

### 1. Complete Authentication System

- Implement any missing security features
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Add email verification for new accounts

### 2. Enhance Frontend-Backend Integration

- Ensure all API endpoints are correctly integrated
- Implement proper error handling for API requests
- Add loading states for better user experience

### 3. Optimize Data Visualization

- Fix any chart rendering issues
- Ensure charts load correctly on initial render
- Add proper cleanup for chart components

### 4. Implement Comprehensive Testing

- Create unit tests for critical components
- Test the complete forecast flow
- Test authentication integration with forecast saving

### 5. Prepare for Deployment

- Create production build
- Set up proper environment variables
- Document deployment process

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that all functionality is working correctly:

### Authentication

- [ ] User registration with valid credentials
- [ ] User registration with invalid credentials (validation)
- [ ] User login with valid credentials
